# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was partially developed with assistance from AI tools (ChatGPT).

### AI-assisted components:
- Initial backend architecture scaffolding
- Tailwind UI layout suggestions
- Test case generation for Jest + Supertest + RTL
- GitHub Actions YAML template
- Documentation drafts (README.md, EVAL.md, OPENAPI.yaml)

### Non-AI components:
- Final implementation decisions
- Business logic for image generation
- React components and hooks structure
- Error handling and retry logic
- Debugging and integration of CI

All AI-generated content was reviewed, validated, and modified as needed.
